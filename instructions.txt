1) Create an input field (in the App component) with a change listener which outputs the length of the entered text below it (e.g. in a paragraph).
2) Create a new component(=> ValidationComponent) which receives the text length as a property.
3) Inside the ValidationComponent, either output "Text too short" or "Text long enough" depending on the text length (e.g. take 5 as a minimum length).
4) Create another component (=> CharComponent) and style it as an inline box (=> display: inline-block; padding: 16px; text-align: center; margin: 16px; border: 1px solid black).
5) Render a list of CharComponents where each CharComponent receives a different letter of the entered text (in the initial input field) as a prop.
6) When you click a CharComponent, it should remove the corresponding character from the entered text.

Hint: Keep in mind that JavaScript strings are basically arrays!

You can split a string into an array of characters with the split("") function. By passing just an empty string, it's split after every character.

You may then re-create a string from that array by using the join("") - again, joining with an empty string as a separator.
